Hello there! My name's Daniel and I'm currently a student in my final year at the University of British Columbia, majoring in Computer Science.

My main interests are:


* **increasing my own productivity**

    I'm Linux only (Arch btw) and an Emacs-heavy user (all posts on this site were made using org-mode and ox-hugo). I spend a lot of my free time working on eLisp modules for improving my setup, becuase I enjoy the sense of progression I get when I'm constantly working more effectively.

* **CTFs**

    I'm a happy member of team [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/) and keep track of my progress via writeups. My goal is to write at least 1 writeup for each CTF I participate in, though currently I have a backlog of over 30 CTFs.

* **Low-level system design**

    My main goal is always to expand my range of knowledge, and the depth in abstraction for modern applications is somewhere I can always find something new to learn. I'm currently most interested in operating systems and low-latency video streaming, and am working on some related projects.
