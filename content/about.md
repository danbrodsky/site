Hello there! My name's Daniel and I'm a recent CPSC alumni from the University of British Columbia.

My main goal is always to expand my range of knowledge, and the depth in abstraction for modern applications is somewhere I can always find something new to learn. I spend my free time either playing in CTFs or working on projects to expand my domain of knowledge of all things low-level (hardware design, embedded systems, networking, operating systems, etc). I am a managerial member of my university CTF team [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/), and have played in over 60 CTFs (working mostly on pwn and reversing problems). Our team has finished 1st in Canada on [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/team/73723) for both 2019 and 2020!

I post writeups to CTF problems that I found really interesting occasionally, and also some unrelated posts to my blog.
