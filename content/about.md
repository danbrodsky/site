My name's Daniel Brodsky and I'm currently a student at the University of British Columbia majoring in Computer Science.

My main interests are:

* **Security**

    Security to me is a field where you need to know how everything works so you know how to defend it and I love the idea of learning how everything works!

* **Low-level systems design**

    Similar to security, I just really want to know more about how everything comes together.

* **increasing my own productivity**

    I'm Linux only (Arch btw) and an Emacs/Vim-heavy user, so I've quite nearly given up the need for a mouse altogether. I enjoy the sense of progression I get when I'm constantly getting better at using more effective tools.

* **CTFs**

    I'm gradually replacing my addiction to video games with a desire to `PWN N00BS` in another form. I'm a happy member of team [Maple Bacon](https://ubcctf.github.io/) and keep track of my progress via writeups and my [cookbook](https://github.com/danbrodsky/Cookbook).
